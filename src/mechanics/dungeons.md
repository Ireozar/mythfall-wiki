# Dungeons
Dungeons are a way to fight unique bosses and mobs, and are the primary way to get unique items.

## How do I find a dungeon?
Every time you kill a mob in the regular world (Alivarg's Sphere), you have a chance to trigger a portal spawn. The type of portal that spawns differs based on the mob killed and which area the mob is in.

## Traversing a dungeon
After clearing a room of mobs the barrier to the next set of rooms will disapear and you will be able to enter the next room. Parties of multiple people will find health of the mobs in a dungeon (including the boss) scales based on the size of the party.

## Boss item drops
To be able to get a boss item drop, you need to do a minimum of **10%** of the damage to the boss's total health.

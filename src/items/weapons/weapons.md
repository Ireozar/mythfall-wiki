# Weapons
Weapons in Mythfall come in many different shapes and forms of attack, but with one objective - to help you with defeating your enemies.
Based on the way they attack, they all fall into three separate categories:
- [Swords](./swords/swords.md)
- [Bows](./bows/bows.md)
- [Throwables](./throwables/throwables.md)
